# Introduction

Yagbas is a programming language that builds programs for the Game Boy, as well
as for the three other compatible devices: the Game Boy Pocket, Super Game Boy,
and Game Boy Color. A lot of useful documentation for this device family can be
found in the [Pan Docs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/).

Because of the limited nature of the Game Boy's CPU instruction set, yagbas does
not aim to be a "general purpose" programming language. Instead, it is intended
to be close to "assembly with modern syntax", including control flow constructs.
The language is intended to look "like Rust", when possible.
