# Introduction

Yagbas is a programming language that builds programs for the Game Boy and other
compatible devices. A lot of useful documentation for this device family can be
found in the [Pan Docs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/).

Because of the limited nature of the Game Boy's CPU instruction set, Yagbas does
not aim to be a "general purpose" programming language. Instead, it is intended
to be much closer to "assembly with modern syntax".

Yagbas looks mostly like Rust, where possible.
