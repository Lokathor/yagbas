# Function Calls

## Calling Another Function

One function can call to another by writing the name of the function to call and
then an empty set of parentheses.

```
function_name()
```

Similar to the declaration of a function, future versions of yagbas may place
something within the parentheses, but currently they are always empty.

## Returning From A Function

To return control to the calling function use the `return` keyword.

```
return
```
