# Functions

A function declaration looks like

```
fn NAME() {
  // statements here
}
```

The `fn` keyword marks the start of a function.

Next is an identifier that names the function, followed by an empty set of
parentheses. Future versions of the language may put things into the
parentheses, but in the current version they are always empty.

Finally, we have a set of braces around the code of the function.

The conventional code style for functions is as follows:

* Names are `snake_case`
* Indentation is 2 spaces
* The opening brace is on the same line as the function name
